	<h1>Among Us Jupyter Simulator</h1>

	<p>Using Python in Jupyter Notebook, I am creating a text-to-action simulation of the game, Among Us.</p>

	<div id = "imageSample">
		<div id ="image"><img src="amongUs.png"width=500px, height=300px></div>
		<div id="description"><p>To the left is a small screenshot of the beginning sequence <br> and a few commands you can input (They have not been completed yet)</p></div>
	</div>

	<div id="gameFeatures">

		<div class = gameFeature>
			<p class ="feature">NPCs and Characters</p>
			<p class ="description">In this version of the simulation, you are always the red imposter, among 6 crewmates.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class = gameFeature>
			<p class ="feature">Actions</p>
			<p class ="description">You can take multiple actions similar to regular Among Us in this simulation, such as killing, venting, sabotaging, and of course, moving around.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class = gameFeature>
			<p class ="feature">NPC Behavoir</p>
			<p class ="description">NPC will be controlled by a RNG, selecting randomized values as actions to do tasks, move around, etc. <br>
			Obviously, they will run to call an emergency meeting if they see you vent or kill a fellow crewmate.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class = gameFeature>
			<p class ="feature">Action-Based Outcomes</p>
			<p class ="description">Instead of having outcomes of votes being based on RNG, it is instead based on a variety of actual factors. <br> 
			These include your proximity to dead bodies, if you faked tasks, and NPCs witnessing you at different locations.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class = gameFeature>
			<p class ="feature">Future Ideas</p>
			<p class ="description">After the main functionality of the game is set up, more crewmates will be implemented, along with possibly a NPC fellow imposter, and maybe a choice on game size, map, and roles!</p>
